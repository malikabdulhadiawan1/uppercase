Third-Party Services: Our Apps may use third-party providers (like Google AdMob or Firebase) that collect data such as Advertising IDs to serve ads and analyze traffic.

2. Data Security & Retention
We implement industry-standard measures to protect your data. We retain data only as long as necessary to provide our services and comply with legal obligations.

3. Children’s Privacy
Our Apps are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn such data has been collected, we will delete it immediately.

4. Your Rights (GDPR/CCPA)
Depending on your location, you have the right to access, delete, or limit the use of your data. You can reset your Advertising ID or adjust ad preferences through your device settings.
